# Harry-Potter-Android-Technical-Task Evaluation Task Notes

Task 3 Aim: “Using the APIs available here: HP-API // The Harry Potter API
Your task is to build a Kotlin Android app from the provided project base zip that allows the
user to view the list of Harry Potter characters and their associated information”


Not all task requirements were meant but as a beginner to Kotlin I feel this displays good progress and shows I’m a willing fast learner. 
Approx. time taken was 2 hours to first learn how to complete task using Kotlin (Java is what I’m currently more proficient in) as well as reading up on MVVM design pattern and the Retrofit library for API calls.
